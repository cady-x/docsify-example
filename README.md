MyFavoriteAlbums is a web platform that can analyze and filter user data on music taste and preference. 
Users have the option to filter for number one albums by year (or range of years), see total and average ratings for each artist, 
find top albums by year, see statistics on vinyl ownership, and compare different artists’ album ratings over time. 
MyFavoriteAlbums comes with a user-friendly website that has intuitive controls to help users navigate through the site. 
Additionally, users can generate multiple different visual models of their music-listening statistics.

Users can also modify or replace the dataset that is being used to display statistics, customizing it to their own music taste. 
MyFavoriteAlbums reads data from a .csv file. To learn more about .csv files, check out “What are .csv files?”. 
To learn more about how to customize or create your own .csv file to integrate with MyFavoriteAlbums, 
check out “Creating and adding data to a .csv file”.

Developers wanting to customize the analyses can also modify or add onto the publicly available source code. 
Take a look at “Using MyFavoriteAlbums to generate web pages” to learn more about developing using MyFavoriteAlbums.
